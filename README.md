又见老屋有一支有关老屋的歌，在心里打了很久、很久的漩涡，一直没有唱出来。今年春节，我终于在侄儿的陪同下回了一趟老屋。天！这是那栋我熟悉的亲切的热闹的、生我长我、陪伴了我十八年的老屋么？怎么这般的低矮？我童年、少年眼中那高大、气派的大斗门哪里去了？那142020-12【原创】
/>　　梦刚醒来，天还未亮，睁开眼睛，四周漆黑。梦中情景十分单调，仅仅就是见到了我的爷爷，他没有说一句话，只是满眼忧郁地看着我。我十分纳闷，那双眼睛怎么不是我原来记忆中的眼睛呢？这双眼睛怎么满眼忧郁呢？这忧郁眼神背后，是不是对我焦虑万分的事情的暗示呢？　　爷爷八十三岁那年，这位饱经风霜、可亲可敬的老人，在冬季里一个阳光明媚的午后，在满堂儿孙悲戚的眼神中，那双像阳光一样的眼睛突然间暗淡下来，继而慢慢合上并永远消失了动人的光泽。任凭儿孙怎样撕心裂肺地千呼万唤，爷爷却安详如睡觉般沉沉睡去，那双几个小时前还闪烁着亮光的眼睛，最后用紧闭的姿势给儿孙们留下了最后的记忆和无尽的悲痛。　　我至今仍然觉得，爷爷的眼睛是世界上最美丽的眼睛，爷爷的眼睛不太大，因而不是那种炯炯得会灼伤人的眼睛；爷爷的眼睛也不小，绝对读不出那种贼眉鼠眼的猥琐样。那双眼睛是那样的恰倒好处，藏在花白的长眉毛下并无时不刻地在闪烁着慈祥的亮光。我常常与那双眼睛对视，也很喜欢与那双眼睛对视，我觉得那是一双能抚慰人的眼睛，那是一双能鼓励人的眼睛，那是一双纯洁和透明得像没有一丝云彩的蓝天一样的眼睛。也许是常常与这双眼睛对视的缘故，我不知怎么就觉得人的眼睛是写满着文字的，那些文字的内容各不相同，因而也就会给人有别样的感受。爷爷的眼睛里也是写满文字的，那些文字是养眼和养心的。因为就算你从来不知道慈祥和温和的词汇，看看爷爷的眼睛，你就知道了。　　爷爷眼睛里展示的慈祥和温和的内涵，让我很喜欢亲近爷爷。因为爷爷从没有给我过畏惧感，他的眼睛更不会让人读出畏惧。在我幼时，爷爷的眉毛很粗很黑，待我长大了，爷爷的眉毛不知什么时候就变花白了。在我的印象中，爷爷的眉梢有几根眉毛特别长，年幼时，我常常用小手轻轻拉着爷爷眼睛上面的那些特别长的眉毛，有些时候，手太用力了，爷爷疼得直皱眉，我就赶紧松开小手。而这种时候，爷爷的眼睛同样还是很慈祥、很温和的。慈祥和温和得像春晖，让人感到如春的暖意。我常常觉得，爷爷就是我们整个大家庭中的一个太阳，他在世时，全家人都感受到这个太阳辐射的慈祥和温和的阳光；他驾鹤西去了，这个太阳还悬挂在每个家庭成员的记忆中，并散发着温热的光。　　如今，爷爷已经走了五年时间了。爷爷走后，我常常会时不时地想起这位我十分敬重的老人，时不时会想起他那双慈祥、温和的眼睛，时不时会翻开我珍藏着的老人的遗照，与老人作无声的情感对话，与那双眼睛进行默默地对视，一种温暖悠悠袭来。爷爷走后的五年时间里，我常常盼望爷爷能在我的梦中出现，希望能够与爷爷在梦中相会，再次从他的眼中感受慈祥和温暖。可是，很长时间过去了，我几乎每个晚上都做梦，有时一个晚上甚至做了不止一个梦，但爷爷就是没有在我的梦中出现过。我失望了，我想，也许是阴阳相隔，爷爷是不会回到阳间里的孙子的梦境中了。　　想念慈祥、温和的爷爷的时候，有段时间，我常常不禁地会产生这样一个疑问：就是在极乐世界里的他是否会像生活在人世间的人一样遭遇烦恼？我有这个疑问的时候，其实我正遭遇着一件十分头疼的烦恼事。当时，临产的妻子在县城某局上班，而我却在离县城有一百多公里的一个乡政府工作。妻子需要照料，调到县城去，成为了我的当务之急。然而，我祖祖辈辈都在农村，我的父母亲连县委、政府在什么地方都不知道，我没有靠山，没有后台，仅靠着微薄的工资收入养家糊口，尽管我找了好多熟人，想了很多办法，但调到县城哪怕是经济条件再差的单位都成了我最大的奢望。那段时间，我的情绪低落到极致，我甚至有些怨天尤人、自暴自弃了，但内心深处，我还是期盼着奇迹出现，让我梦想成真。也就是在这段时间的一个晚上，我就做了那个见到爷爷的梦。　　回忆着梦境里的爷爷，我想肯定是爷爷在天有灵，他要么是为我的事情感到忧虑了，要么是因为我的悲观失望而忧心忡忡，因而他才会满眼犹豫的样子。在梦中看到爷爷忧郁的眼神，我的心里更难过了，也觉得自己想调到县城是无望了，更觉得自己灰心散气是多么的不应该……　　此后的一段时间，没有哪个单位考虑到我的家庭情况而将我从一个小乡里调到县城，但我学习更勤奋了，工作的劲头更足了。因为，在我的内心深处，有一双忧郁的眼睛一直在注视着我，我在为这双眼睛不懈努力着，我要让这双眼睛不再犹豫，重放光彩。　　半年后，县城多家单位到我工作的乡里考察我，最终，我成为了县政府办公室的秘书。而今，我已经成为了一个部门的领导，已经建盖起了令人羡慕的新居。而从那以后，爷爷再也没有走进我的梦里。我仍然深深怀念爷爷，祈求他在天国里幸福平安。我感谢爷爷的眼睛，他温和、慈祥的目光曾经一度把我温暖，至今依然让我怀想；他在我梦中仅有一次的忧郁眼神，让我学会了在困难面前顽强拼搏、不懈奋斗，用自己的辛劳和汗水去换取生活的甜蜜。

And see the house there is a song about the house, in the heart to play for a long time, for a long time, hasn't been sung.
This year the Spring Festival, I finally in my nephew, accompanied by a visit to our old house next time.
Day!
This is that I am familiar with the kind of busy, I I long, accompany my eighteen years old?
How so low?
My childhood that tall, handsome, young eyes big doumen where go to?
The 142020-12 "original"
/ > dream just wake up, the day is not bright, opened his eyes, surrounded by darkness.
Dream scene is very monotonous, just to see my grandpa, he didn't say a word, just looked at me with depression.
I was wondering, how do those eyes is not my original memory of the eye?
This pair of eyes how eyeful depression?
Behind this melancholy eyes, isn't it a hint of anxious for me?
Grandpa was eighty-three years old, the weather-beaten, amiable honorable old man, in a sunny winter afternoon, in the eyes of sorrow, and children like sunshine's eyes suddenly dim down, and then slowly closed and disappeared forever moving luster.
Let the children and grandchildren how tore heart crack lung, grandpa is peaceful as a sleeping sleep, several hours before flashing light eyes, finally in the closed position to sons left last memory and endless grief.
I still feel that grandpa's eyes is the world's most beautiful eyes, grandpa's eyes is not too big, and therefore is not the sort of intense burn people's eyes;
Grandpa's eyes are not small, definitely read to rub out the sample.
Eyes are just pour advantage, hidden under the long white eyebrows and time in flashing the light of kindness.
I often looked at with eyes, also like and eyes look each other in the eye, I think it is a pair of can soothe people's eyes, that is a pair of can encourage people's eyes, that is a pair of pure and transparent like not a cloud in the blue sky in the eye.
Perhaps was because often with this pair of eye contact, I don't know how to feel the person's eye is write full text, the text content each are not identical, and therefore will have different feelings to the person.
Grandpa's eyes also write full text, the text is beautiful and yangxin.
Because even if you never know what kind and gentle words, see grandpa's eyes, you will know.
Grandpa eyes show the connotation of the kind and gentle, let I like close to grandpa.
Because grandpa never give me fear, his eyes read more won't let a person fear.
In my childhood, grandpa is very thick black eyebrows, after I grow up, grandpa's eyebrows don't know what time is going grey.
In my impression, grandpa's choosing several special long eyebrows, at a young age, I often use hand gently took grandfather eyes above those special long eyebrows, in some cases, hand too hard, grandpa pain straight frown, I quickly loosen your hands.
But this time, grandpa's eyes is also very kind, very gentle.
Kind and gentle like chunhui, let a person feel spring-like warmth.
I often think, grandpa is one of our whole family the sun, when he is alive, the whole family to feel this kind of solar radiation and gentle sunshine;
He was riding crane west, the sun is hanging in the memory of each family member, and sending out the warm light.
Today, my grandpa had gone for five years.
Grandpa left, I often think of this I respect from time to time, from time to time think of his kind, gentle eyes, occasionally turn I treasure the centerpiece of the old man, and the old man silent emotional dialogue, silently looked at with eyes, a warm leisurely.
Grandpa go after five years, I often hope grandpa can appear in my dream, hope to be able to meet grandpa in the dream, feel nice and warm again from his eyes.
But, in the past for a long time, I almost every night dreaming, sometimes even a night more than a dream, but grandpa is not appeared in my dream.
Me down, I think, maybe is apart of Yin and Yang, grandpa won't come back to the grandson of dreams in the dead.
Thinking of kind, gentle grandfather, for a time, I often can't help to produce such a question: is in seventh heaven if he will like living in this world who encounter trouble?
I have this question, in fact I is suffering a a very headache troubles.
At that time, the wife in a county in labor bureau to work, but I was in the more than one hundred km from the county seat of township government work.
Wife to care for, transferred to the county seat, became my priority.
However, my ancestors were in the countryside, my parents don't even know where the county party committee and government, I have no support, no background, only by a small wage income breadwinner, although I got a lot of acquaintances, want to a number of ways, but transferred to the county seat even in bad economic conditions of the unit is my greatest hope.
During that time, my mood to the extreme, I even some of the odds, degraded, but deep down, I am still looking forward to the miracle appear, let my dream come true.
A night in this period of time, I will do the seeing grandpa's dream.
Recalled dreams of grandpa, I'm sure is grandpa in heaven, he is worried about the things for me either, or because I'm disappointed and worried, so he will be with hesitation.
See grandpa blue eyes in my dream, my heart more sad, also feel oneself want to transferred to the county seat is hopeless, how much more feel frustrated the bulk gas should not be...
After a period of time, no unit considering the condition of my family and I'm from a small village to the county seat, but I learn more diligent, more foot work harder.
Because, in my heart of hearts, have a pair of blue eyes have been staring at me, I'm trying to make great efforts in this pair of eyes, I want to let this pair of eyes no longer hesitate, replay.
After six months, the county seat of units to my work on my village, in the end, I became the secretary of the county government office.
Now, I have become a leadership, has been built has built an enviable new homes.
And from then on, grandpa never into my dream.
I still miss grandpa, pray for peace and happiness in the kingdom of heaven.
I thank grandpa's eyes, he's gentle, kind eyes once warm me, still let I thought;
He only once in my dream melancholy eyes, let I learned to be indomitable in the face of hardships, unremitting struggle, with their own hard work and sweat for the sweetness of life.
